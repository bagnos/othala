The tape is mostly formed in various shapes depending on its appearance and proportions after knotting. Normally the tape has a system to adjust the length to adapt the garment at the neck sizes without changing the shape and size of the node. <br/><br/>The pre-assembled type, a brooch or a collar, is an adaptation of the traditional one-latest, unloved by many followers of the object, in which the node is sewing, which can also be adjusted in length. <br/><br/>The bow-tie can be made of different materials, silk, cotton, wool or other and with different geometric designs or fancy, just like the tie. <br/><br/>But there is a papillon required: the black Tuxedo bow tie which is usually silk or satin, the same material of the sash, if any; the frac white papillon, which is mostly in the skin of the egg or piquet, more rarely in silk.

footer_prod10Text=Sartorial jacket that Centopercento Camicie proposes is cured in every detail and artisan methods which give follows a dry fit. In fact the jacket can be with high and sustained lapels, wide or important; shoulders dropped and absolutely devoid of padding, the sleeve is the classic \u201Dnapoletana\u201D o \u201Cshirt sleeves\u201D, armhole from adhering.    <br/><br/>The slots of the sleeves are sewn by hand and then the buttons you can unfasten. Refined detail that denotes a well-made sartorial jacket. <br/><br/>Men's jackets are available in different models and patterns can be double or single breasted double-breasted three buttons or buttons, can have the pockets or cutting straight or inclined, patch, with or without flap. For the best nights, there are surely full jackets, ideal to complete your elegant estates, to splurge on occasions when be chic is de rigueur. <br/><br/><br/>How to recognize a jacket made for art? First of all it is good to keep in mind what are the critical points of the jacket, namely\: shoulders, chest, neck and armholes. <br/><br/>\tSHOULDERS<br/>\uF0D8\tThe shoulders must be sufficiently large to allow the outside of the sleeves down freely, avoiding unsightly bulges caused by the presence of the arm muscles. <br/><br/>\tTHORAX<br/>\uF0D8\tThe thorax must be off the point at the right spot, so as to enable easy buttoning, and remain comfortable even while sitting. If the jacket has three buttons must be connected to the Central button, while if it is two buttons using the upper one; the bottom button is not connected at all. <br/><br/>\u201CDROP\u201D <br/>\uF0D8\tDrop another detail to keep in mind is the drop, i.e. the ratio of the width of the chest and the waist; adequate reports are for example, considering the size of fifty\: drop 8 for those with a life close to the chest, 6 for a normal relationship, and 4 for those with large life or a protruding belly. Unfortunately for commercial reasons, the most common is to drop the Middle, the 6. <br/><br/>ARMHOLE<br/>\uF0D8\tThat armhole is another sensitive point; It must be cut so that its bottom fits comfortably under the armpit, without being tight. When it is too deep, it is definitely a defect. After you have tried a jacket packed it is advisable not to buy if you have doubts about the capabilities of the armholes. <br/><br/>NECK<br/>\uF0D8\tThe first particular note on the neck of the jacket is that it must adhere well, in the back, the neck of the shirt and remain tight even when moving or lifting the arms. <br/><br/><br/>Errors to be avoided in the choice and in the use of the jacket\:\t<br/><br/>\u2022\tTo lace all and three the buttons of the jacket single-breasted; <br/>\u2022\tTo divide a complete suit (except that of corduroy); <br/>\u2022\tFancy Jacket or canvas with patterns that do not match the picture; <br/>\u2022\tJacket with large herringbone; <br/>\u2022\tJacket with tips the lapels too low; <br/>\u2022\tJacket with lining to pictures or to flowers ;     <br/>\u2022\tJacket of synthetic fabric; <br/>\u2022\tJacket with the shoulder pads; <br/>\u2022\tJacket plum color, lobster or green clear. <br/>
